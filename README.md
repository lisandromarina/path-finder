## Introduction

Path finding is a fundamental concept in computer science, robotics, and games. It involves finding the optimal or shortest path between a start point and an end point in a given environment. The Path Finder tool allows users to interactively visualize the process of various pathfinding algorithms, making it an excellent learning resource for students and developers.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based environment for visualization.
- Supports popular pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Customizable start and end points, walls, and other obstacles.
- Real-time visualization of the algorithm's exploration and pathfinding steps.
- Easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls.
